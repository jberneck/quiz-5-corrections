Question 1
When defining our own class, we should provide one or more constructor methods. If we fail to provide one, the compiler will generate 
a default one that takes 1 parameter(s).
Answer 1:
Correct!
constructor
Answer 2:
Correct Answer:
0
This is correct because there is a default feature for most of the syntax and this is one of them.

Question 2
In order to implement the toString method, what annotation do you need to include?
Correct Answer
@Override
Using the annotation @Override informs the compiler that the element is meant to override an element declared in a superclass, 
while using the annotation @Private indicates that the constructor is private.

Question 3
Consider the following partial class definition.

public class Quiz {

    private int numberOfQuestions;
    private String instructionalUnit;

    public Quiz() {

    }
}
numberOfQuestions and instructionalUnit are examples of...?
Correct Answer
instance variables
They are variables that are being deliberately altered during a specific instance.

Question 4
From a classification perspective, a setter method is a(n)...?
Correct Answer
  mutator
  This is correct because a setter allows that manipulation of classes.
  
  
Question 8
Consider the following partially implemented class.

public class Quiz {

    private static int id = 1;
    private int questionCount;

    public Quiz(int questionCount) {
        this.questionCount = questionCount;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void incrementId() {
        id++;
    }

    public int getQuestionCount() {
        return questionCount;
    }
}
Now, consider the following usage of the aforementioned class.

Quiz q1 = new Quiz(10);
Quiz q2 = new Quiz(15);
q2.incrementId();

System.out.println(q1.getId());
System.out.println(q2.getId());
System.out.println(q1.getQuestionCount());
System.out.println(q2.getQuestionCount());
What will be printed to the console?
Correct Answer
  
2
2
10
15
These are the correct answers as 2 is the id number of both quizzes, but quiz 2 has 10 questions with the other having 15.

Question 9
In most cases, programmers provide a   method to access the values of their instance variables from other classes. Likewise, 
they provide a  method to update the values of their instance variables from other classes.
Answer 1:
Correct Answer
getter 
Answer 2:
Correct Answer
setter 
These are correct as tehy fill the requirements of the question??
